# Otto DIY

This Repository have all open source files for my version of the popular Otto DIY 
The Arduino code is modified from the Zowi robot, it has modified to wotk with a MAX 7219 LED MATRIX as as mouth as well as other adjustments.

Please copy all the files in the OTTO_Library folder to the Arduino IDE Library folder


The code is based on the Zowi code, modified for OTTO

Please NOTE: i have moved the BUZZER to pin D13............

Please NOTE: you need pull-down resistors on the button pins............

Please NOTE: you will need a link between A7 and +5 volt to fool low battery warnings

The modified OTTO main program is  inside the OTTO_LEDMATRIX folder, ensure you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE.
The modifed ZOWI main program is inside the ZOWI_BASE_v2_MATRIX folder, ensure you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE.


Happy roboting....


Otto was inspired by another robot BoB the BiPed and programmed using code from [another open source biped robot Zowi](https://github.com/bqlabs/zowi)

Otto's differences are in the assembled size (11cm x 7cm x12cm), cleaner integration of components and expressions. 
Using off the shelf and 3D printed parts, simple electronics connections (almost no welding required), and basic coding skills, [you will be able to build your own cute Otto friend in as little as two hours!](http://www.instructables.com/id/Otto-Build-You-Own-Robot-in-Two-Hours/)

### Otto is design using Autodesk 123D Design software 
[You can modify it for customization](http://www.123dapp.com/Project/Otto-build-your-own-robot/5658683) or further improvements!
Gather all the off the shelf parts in the [BOM file] (https://github.com/OttoDIY/Otto/blob/master/OTTO_V02_BOM_STP_STL/OTTO_BOM.xlsx) that you'll need for this assembly, then follow [the instruction manual] (https://github.com/OttoDIY/Otto/blob/master/OTTO_V02_BOM_STP_STL/OTTO_InstructionManual_V02.pdf)
